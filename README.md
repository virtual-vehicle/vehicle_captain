# vehicleCAPTAIN
The vehicle communication platform to anything (vehicleCAPTAIN) is a collection of software to enable a quick entry into the vehicle-to-anything (V2X) domain.

## Repositories
The vehicleCAPTAIN is structured into the following components:

- ITS Message Libraries (with ETSI source)
  - [C/CXX](https://github.com/virtual-vehicle/vehicle_captain_its_lib_c_cxx):
    is autogenerated from [ETSI sources](https://forge.etsi.org/rep/ITS/asn1) with CXX wrapper.
    (Release Expected Q1 2023)
- Platform
  - [Routing Core](https://github.com/virtual-vehicle/vehicle_captain_routing_core):
    is a program that can support multiple V2X hardware components with only one interface.
    (Release Expected Q1 2023)
  - [Receiver Example](https://github.com/virtual-vehicle/vehicle_captain_routing_receiver_example):
    is a receiver example for the routing software
    (Release Expected Q1 2023)
  - [Sender Example](https://github.com/virtual-vehicle/vehicle_captain_routing_sender_example):
    is a sender example for the routing software
    (Release Expected Q1 2023)
- ROS2 Support
  - [ROS2 ITS Messages](https://github.com/virtual-vehicle/v2x_msgs):
    is an autogenerated library from [ETSI sources](https://forge.etsi.org/rep/ITS/asn1) for ROS2.
    (Release Expected Q1 2023)
  - [ROS2 V2X Gateway](https://github.com/virtual-vehicle/v2x_gw):
    is a translator for asn1 messages to ROS2 type messages.
    (Release Expected Q1 2023)
- Tools
  - [asn1 parser](https://github.com/virtual-vehicle/vehicle_captain_asn1_parser):
    is a fork of an FOSS [asn1 parser](https://github.com/brchiu/asn1c/tree/velichkov_s1ap_plus_option_group_plus_adding_trailing_ull) to autogenerate ROS2 messages from [ETSI sources](https://forge.etsi.org/rep/ITS/asn1).
    (Release Expected Q1 2023)
